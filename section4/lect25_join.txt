### Join 2 tables using a common column

head(x)

## name added new
## left_join keeps all observations of LHS var

head(weather)

y = flights2 %>% left_join(weather)

## join by common col: year, month, day

head(y)

##semi-join: keep all observations in x that match y

topd = flights %>% count(dest, sort=TRUE) %>% head(10)
head(topd)

flights %>% semi_join(topd) 

##anti-join: drop all observations in x that match y
## good for discovering mismatch
## identify flights that don't have a match in planes

flights %>% anti_join(planes, by="tailnum") %>%
  count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)
